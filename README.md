NPWD is our flagship and current running project. Our team has been working on the project since August, 2020. This resource isnâ€™t complete yet and currently has no ETA for release. Feel free to test it out in a dev environment by following the installation guide.

Written completely by the Project Error Dev Team in [React](https://reactjs.org/) with a [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) client/server environment.

## Project Error Discord

- Join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYwBjTbAY5) to follow current development of the project.

## Documentation & Installation

- [Project-Error Docs](https://docs.projecterror.dev/#/) contains all the information regarding this resource. Please consult it for installation, dependencies, and other important information.

## Support

No support is being provided currently for the resource as it is still in an unfinished state.

Should you encounter any issues, please do the following:

- Check the [Git Kraken](https://app.gitkraken.com/glo/board/X9YZ_x_SVQEcMwpH) to see if the issue you're referring to is already tracked.
- Check the [State of Development](https://docs.projecterror.dev/#/npwd/state-of-dev?id=introduction) to see if the app is still a **WIP**.
  - If the issue isn't on the Git Kraken and the app is finished, please open an issue.
  - If the issue isn't on the Git Kraken and the app is **not** finished, please contact us in Discord.

We do not want issues opened that are due to the phone being **WIP** as this slows down development since we now have to address it more immediately.
